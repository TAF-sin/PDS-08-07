## Overview

The main objective of this project is to predict loan default by performing the following steps:

- **Preprocessing:**  
  - Fill missing values in numerical features with the column mean.
  - Fill missing values in categorical features with the mode.
  - Convert categorical features to numerical values using label encoding.

- **Visualization:**  
  - Plot loan approval rates based on income levels using bar charts.

- **Modeling:**  
  - Train a logistic regression model.
  - Evaluate model performance using precisionâ€“recall curves.

## Dataset

The project uses the [Loan Prediction Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets). Please download the dataset (for example, `loan_data.csv`) and place it in the `data/` directory.
